:warning: Website building in progress, please don't trust anything here for now. Thank you for your understanding.

Welcome to my homepage! In Fall 2023, I started my PhD program in the [Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://www.ise.ufl.edu/) at the University of Florida. 
I'm working with [Dr. Aleksandr Kazachkov](https://akazachk.github.io/) in the Center of Applied Optimization. 
My research interests include helping MIP (Mixed Integer Programming) solver making smarter decisions and computational economics (fair devision, etc.)

I spend my spare time on dancing (chinese dance, ballet basics, sportive latin american ballroom dance), listening to music, making handicrafts, and playing with my cat Yuanxiao :smiley_cat: .

I'm currently the secretary of the [INFORMS Student Chapter at UF](https://www.ise.ufl.edu/informs/). Feel free to reach out to me if you are interested in my research, my hobbies, our student chapter, or just want to say hi! :blush:
