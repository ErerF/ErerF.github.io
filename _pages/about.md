!! Website building in progress, please don't trust anything here for now. Thank you for your understanding.!!

Welcome to my homepage! I'm a second year PhD student in the [Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://www.ise.ufl.edu/) at the University of Florida. I'm working with [Dr. Aleksandr Kazachkov](https://akazachk.github.io/) in the Center of Applied Optimization.

My current research focuses on helping MIP (Mixed Integer Programming) solver making smart decisions

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
